            <h3 id="under-surface">Under the Surface</h3>
            <p>The West Coast is world famous for its Pacific salmon runs and recreational sport fishery that’s available to eager anglers flocking to try their hand, or knuckles, at landing some monster salmon. Wild Chinook (King) Coho (Silver) Sockeye, Pink and Chum (Dogfish) are all available through varying months of the year in Tofino. The big banks and fishing holes around the coast offer up outstanding bottom fishing for giant halibut, snapper (yellow eye) lingcod and rockfish. Offshore fishing is available for albacore tuna when in season and weather cooperates. Pacific albacore are prized for their meat and texture and considered to be sushi grade (meaning they can be eaten raw).</p>
            <p>The best part about our Tofino location is the majority of the hottest fishing grounds are a thirty-minute run or less from the barn. Expect the unexpected when you’re on the water with Coastal. Couple the mystique and excitement with fantastic weather, a thriving community of helpful locals and service staff and your adventures in Tofino will not be something soon forgotten.</p>

                <h3>RESULTS!!</h3>
                <p>Had a wicked day on the water with tons of action. Our guide was awesome and we really appreciated his knowledge as well as his approach to conservation. Great price and Brin went the extra mile to ensure our comfort and safety. Absolutely recommend this one! We will definitely use Brin's charter in the future!!</p>

                <h3>Fishing in the open sea</h3>
                <p>Our captain took us out on the open sea ~ 45 minutes from the Tofino marina. He was very knowledgeable about good spots to fish and the boat was in great shape. Each of us caught at least one big salmon and had a great time. Around lunch time we came back to the marina and my young nephew came out to fish with the group in a closer area. The captain was very helpful with showing him what to do and he caught his first fish! Overall a great experience and would highly recommend this charter company.</p>
